**Title**: "Detecting the full potential of intelligent machines: towards an
observation-based approach"  
**Abstract**:  "When measuring intelligence of living beings, a open approach is often used. In the case of humans, a battery of tests is chosen and submitted, while in the case of animals it’s a usual thing to observe their behavior to detect intelligent actions. But this is not the case for machines, in which the historical methods to test for intelligence, like the Turing Test, are heavily humanbiased. I argue that these methods don’t sufficiently explore the machine’s possibilities, risking to miss some important insights on all the intelligent behaviors these AIs can show. I explain the motivations for this claims, starting from some basic assumptions about minds and intelligence. Then, I propose a change of paradigm in studying AIs’ intelligence, from testing in an active way to observing spontaneous behaviors, reducing the extent to which intelligence relates to humans. After unfolding three main adaptations to make it possible, I claim that observing spontaneous actions in machines may be a new possibility in AI research, and that spontaneity may be the next marker for machine thinking."
